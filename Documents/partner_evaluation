Graphs and pacman Homework 9 - Partner Evaluation
My Name: Chloe Josien
Partner: Haisley Brooking
Date:    March 29, 2017

Hours Worked on Project: 4 hours

Partner Score: # - 3 

Group Analysis: 
What I learned from Haisley is to not be afraid to ask questions. We got done
quickly this week because we asked the TA's a lot of questions. What Haisley learned from
me is when something doesn't work to start going through the code as if you were the computer

Our group worked/didn't work because.....
Our group worked well together because we have a similar coding style
and skill level so we were able to put our knowledge to efficently
solve this weeks project.
