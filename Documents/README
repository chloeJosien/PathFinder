Graphs and Pacman (Assignment 9)

Project summary: In this project we learned how to create an agency list of nodes
to help find the shortest path using a graph data structure. 

Notes to TA: We used a character array to keep track of empty spaces instead of an integer array.
each node has a row and column so we can find them in the character array faster.
we have a test in main to print the number of times a node is checked

Pledge:  I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write
this program (such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely
manner).  I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or
recreate.  Any sources (e.g., web sites) other than the lecture that I used to
help write the code are cited in my work.  When working with a partner, I have
contributed an equal share and understand all the submitted work.  Further, I have
 helped write all the code assigned as pair-programming and reviewed all code that
was written separately.

Design Decisions: We used a character array to help keep track of the nodes.

Problems Encountered and Solutions: The hardest part of this project was understand but once
we understood it was simple.
